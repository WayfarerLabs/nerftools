# Nerf Manifest Reference

A nerf manifest is a YAML file that declares tools within a package. Multiple manifests can
contribute to the same package. When they share a `package.name`, tools are merged with last-wins
semantics. The manifest is the source of truth for tool definitions, parameter specs, safety
guardrails, threat metadata, and AI skill documentation.

Each tool defines exactly **one execution mode** (`template`, `passthrough`, or `script`) plus
optional lifecycle hooks and shared configuration. The `nerf` CLI reads manifests and generates
self-contained bash scripts, rulesync skills, and Claude Code plugins.

Generated scripts target **bash** (not POSIX sh).

## Quick start

A minimal manifest with one tool:

```yaml
version: 1

package:
  name: git
  description: Git workflow tools
  skill_group: git

tools:
  git-log:
    description: Show recent commits
    threat:
      read: workspace
      write: none
    template:
      command: [git, log, --oneline, -20]
```

Validate and generate:

```bash
nerf validate manifest.yaml
nerf generate --target bin --outdir ./bin manifest.yaml
```

## Versioning

Every manifest declares its spec version as a top-level integer:

```yaml
version: 1
```

- The `version` field is required.
- The value is a single integer (major version only).
- The current version is **1**.
- The CLI validates against the declared version's schema.
- Backwards-incompatible changes require a version bump. Additive changes (new optional fields) do
  not.

## Terminology

These terms are used consistently throughout manifests, generated scripts, and generated
documentation.

### Token

A **token** is a single raw element of `$@`, one shell argument as received by the script. Before
parsing, every `$1`, `$2`, etc. is just a token.

Passthrough mode operates **exclusively at the token level**. It never classifies tokens; it scans
them against deny rules and forwards them as-is.

### Parameter types (template and script modes)

| Term         | What it is                                                             | Tokens consumed | Syntax           | Example           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| **switch**   | Boolean flag. Present or absent, no value.                             | 1               | `--flag` or `-f` | `--verbose`       |
| **option**   | Named flag + value (two tokens: **option flag** and **option value**). | 2               | `--flag <value>` | `--remote origin` |
| **argument** | Positional value identified by position, not by a flag.                | 1               | `<value>`        | `origin`          |

### Prefix and suffix tokens (passthrough mode)

**Prefix tokens** are static tokens inserted before the user's tokens. **Suffix tokens** are
inserted after. Both are hardcoded in the manifest.

```text
exec <command> <prefix...> "$@" <suffix...>
```

### Pre-flight hooks

Pre-flight hooks are inline bash snippets that run before the main execution of the tool. They can
be used to perform checks, set up environment variables, or otherwise prepare the execution context
before the main command runs.

### Guards

Guards are boolean checks that run before the main execution of the tool. Each guard is a bash
expression that must evaluate to true for the tool to proceed. If any guard fails, the tool aborts
execution. Guards are useful for enforcing preconditions, such as verifying that required files
exist or that the environment is correctly configured.

### Invocation order

Switches and options must come before arguments. The generated parser stops consuming flags at the
first non-flag token (or `--`).

```text
nerf-tool [switches] [options] [--] <arguments...>
```

### Variadic argument (templates)

A **variadic argument** collects all remaining positional values into a bash array. At most one
variadic argument is allowed per tool, and it must be the last argument, both to the nerf tool and
to the underlying wrapped CLI utility.

## Package

Top-level metadata about the tool package.

```yaml
package:
  name: <string> # Unique package identifier (e.g. "git", "nx")
  description: <string> # Human-readable description of the package
  skill_group: <string> # Skill directory name (usually matches name)
  skill_intro: <string> # Optional multi-line intro for AI skill docs
```

All fields except `skill_intro` are required.

## Tool definition

```yaml
tools:
  <tool-name>:
    description: <string> # Required. What the tool does.
    threat: # Required. Risk classification.
      read: <scope> #   none|workspace|machine|remote|admin
      write: <scope> #   none|workspace|machine|remote|admin

    # Execution mode (exactly one required):
    template: { ... } # Build a command from a template
    passthrough: { ... } # Forward tokens with a deny-list
    script: <string> # Inline bash script

    # Parameters (optional, template and script only):
    switches: { ... }
    options: { ... }
    arguments: { ... }

    # Lifecycle (optional, all modes):
    pre: <string> # Inline bash run before main execution
    guards: # Pre-flight boolean checks
      - { ... }

    # Environment (optional):
    env: { ... } # Key-value pairs exported before execution
```

- Exactly one of `template`, `passthrough`, or `script` must be set.
- `switches`, `options`, and `arguments` are **not allowed** with `passthrough`.

## Threat model

Every tool declares a two-dimensional threat profile: what it **reads** and what it **writes**. This
metadata enables operators to grant permissions by risk scope rather than enumerating individual
tools.

```yaml
threat:
  read: <scope>
  write: <scope>
```

The threat profile is metadata only and does not change what the tool does. Enforcement is at the
permission layer (nerfctl grant commands, settings.json).

### Scopes (ordered, narrow to broad)

| Scope       | Meaning                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`      | No access in this dimension.                            |
| `workspace` | Confined to the current workspace directory tree.       |
| `machine`   | Anywhere on the local filesystem.                       |
| `remote`    | Network operations: APIs, remote repos, cloud services. |
| `admin`     | Destructive, irreversible, or elevated operations.      |

### Examples

| Tool               | Read      | Write     | Rationale                                   |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `git log`          | workspace | none      | Reads repo history, writes nothing          |
| `git add`          | workspace | workspace | Reads and modifies the staging area         |
| `git fetch`        | remote    | workspace | Downloads from remote, writes to local refs |
| `git push`         | workspace | remote    | Reads local refs, writes to remote          |
| `find .`           | workspace | none      | Reads directory tree under workspace root   |
| `cspell`           | workspace | none      | Reads files, reports issues                 |
| `prettier --write` | workspace | workspace | Reads and reformats files                   |

### Scope comparison

Scopes are ordered: `none < workspace < machine < remote < admin`. A tool is within a grant ceiling
when `tool.read <= ceiling.read AND tool.write <= ceiling.write`.

### Embedded metadata

Generated scripts include the threat profile as structured comments:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# nerf-git-push-branch -- Push the current branch to a remote
# Generated from git manifest. Do not edit directly.
# nerf:threat:read=workspace
# nerf:threat:write=remote
```

This enables runtime tool discovery and threat classification without the manifest.

## Execution modes

### template

Build a command from an explicit template with `{{kind.name}}` placeholders. Best for wrapping a
single tool call where you want full control over exposed parameters.

```yaml
template:
  command: [<string>, ...] # Command parts with {{kind.name}} placeholders
  npm_pkgrun: <bool> # Use bunx/pnpx/npx resolver (default: false)
```

Rules:

- Every `{{kind.name}}` in `command` must be defined in `switches`, `options`, or `arguments`.
- Every parameter must be referenced by a `{{kind.name}}` in `command`.
- A variadic argument's `{{kind.name}}` must be the last element of `command`.
- The generated script ends with `exec`, replacing the process.

Example:

```yaml
git-commit:
  description: Create a git commit with a Conventional Commits message
  threat:
    read: workspace
    write: workspace
  template:
    command: [git, commit, -m, "{{arguments.message}}"]
  arguments:
    message:
      description: "Commit message: type[(scope)][!]: description"
      required: true
      pattern:
        "^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\\([a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\\))?!?:
        .+"
  guards:
    - script: "! git diff --cached --quiet"
      fail_message: No staged changes. Use git-add to stage changes first.
```

### passthrough

Forward all tokens to an underlying command, rejecting any that match a deny list. Best for exposing
a tool mostly as-is while removing dangerous capabilities.

Passthrough mode operates **exclusively at the token level**. There is no parsing, no classification
into switches/options/arguments. Every element of `$@` is scanned against deny rules and forwarded
as-is.

```yaml
passthrough:
  command: <string> # Underlying command name
  deny: [<string>, ...] # Glob patterns to reject (optional)
  prefix: [<string>, ...] # Static tokens before user tokens (optional)
  suffix: [<string>, ...] # Static tokens after user tokens (optional)
```

**Deny list matching:** each entry is a glob pattern matched against every token. Glob
metacharacters are `*`, `?`, `[`, `]`. A pattern without metacharacters is an exact match.

| Pattern    | Matches         | Does not match |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| `--delete` | `--delete`      | `--delete-all` |
| `-ok*`     | `-ok`, `-okdir` | `--ok`         |

To match a literal metacharacter, escape with `\`. In YAML, use single quotes (`'\*'`) or double the
backslash (`"\\*"`).

Example:

```yaml
safe-find:
  description: Run find without exec capabilities
  threat:
    read: workspace
    write: none
  passthrough:
    command: find
    deny: [-exec, -execdir, -ok, -okdir, -delete]
    prefix: [.]
```

### script

Run an inline bash script. Best for tools that need custom logic beyond wrapping a single command.

```yaml
script: |
  <bash script body>
```

- Parameters are parsed and available as shell variables before the script runs.
- The script runs in the main shell (not a subshell). Its exit code becomes the tool's exit code.
- There is no `exec`. The script controls its own flow.

Example:

```yaml
deploy-check:
  description: Validate deployment readiness
  threat:
    read: remote
    write: remote
  script: |
    echo "Checking ${ENVIRONMENT}..."
    if [ "$DRY_RUN" = "true" ]; then
      echo "(dry run)" >&2
      exit 0
    fi
    terraform plan -detailed-exitcode
    rc=$?
    if [ $rc -eq 2 ]; then
      echo "Changes pending — review required" >&2
      exit 1
    fi
  arguments:
    environment:
      description: Target environment
      required: true
      allow: [staging, production]
  switches:
    dry_run:
      description: Skip actual checks
```

## Parameter specs

Parameters are only allowed with `template` and `script` modes. Names must not overlap across
`switches`, `options`, and `arguments` within a single tool.

All parameter values are stored as shell variables with the name uppercased and dashes replaced by
underscores (e.g. `my-param` becomes `MY_PARAM`).

### switches

A boolean flag, present or absent, with no value. Switches are always optional.

```yaml
switches:
  <name>:
    description: <string> # Required
    flag: <string> # Override flag (default: --<name> with _ replaced by -)
    short: <string> # Single-char short form (e.g. -v)
    repeatable: <bool> # Can be passed multiple times (default: false)
```

The shell variable is `"true"` when present, `""` when absent. For repeatable switches, the variable
is an integer count (0 when absent, incremented each time the switch is passed).

Rules:

- `flag` must match `-<name>` or `--<name>` pattern.
- `short` must match `-[a-zA-Z]`.

### options

A named flag that takes exactly one value.

```yaml
options:
  <name>:
    description: <string> # Required
    flag: <string> # Override flag (default: --<name> with _ replaced by -)
    short: <string> # Single-char short form
    required: <bool> # Default: false
    repeatable: <bool> # Can be passed multiple times (default: false)
    pattern: <string> # Regex the value must match (auto-anchored with ^...$)
    allow: [<string>, ...] # Exhaustive list of allowed values
    deny: [<string>, ...] # Values to reject
```

Rules:

- `allow` and `deny` are mutually exclusive.
- `flag` must match `-<name>` or `--<name>` pattern.
- `short` must match `-[a-zA-Z]`.
- `pattern` is automatically anchored to a full match in the generated bash script.
- When `repeatable: true`, the option can be passed multiple times. The generated script accumulates
  flag-value pairs in an array so `"${VAR[@]}"` expands to `--flag val1 --flag val2`.

### arguments

A positional argument identified by position.

```yaml
arguments:
  <name>:
    description: <string> # Required
    required: <bool> # Default: false
    variadic: <bool> # Collect remaining args into array (default: false)
    allow_flags: <bool> # Allow flag-like tokens in variadic args (default: false)
    pattern: <string> # Regex the value must match (auto-anchored)
    allow: [<string>, ...] # Exhaustive list of allowed values
    deny: [<string>, ...] # Values to reject
```

Rules:

- `allow` and `deny` are mutually exclusive.
- At most one argument may be `variadic`, and it must be the last in `arguments`.
- In `template` mode, a variadic `{{kind.name}}` must be the last element in `template.command`.
- Variadic arguments become bash arrays; all others become scalar variables.
- By default, variadic arguments reject tokens starting with `-` to prevent flag injection. Set
  `allow_flags: true` when forwarding to a tool that expects its own flags (e.g. pytest, ruff).

## Lifecycle

### Execution order

```text
guards → pre → main (template exec | passthrough exec | script run)
```

### guards

Pre-flight boolean checks that run before the main execution.

```yaml
guards:
  - fail_message: <string> # Required. Shown on failure.
    command: [<string>, ...] # Run as subprocess, output suppressed
    # OR
    script: <string> # Inline bash snippet
```

Exactly one of `command` or `script`. The check passes on exit code 0. `{{kind.name}}` placeholders
are substituted with parameter values.

### pre

An inline bash script that runs before the main execution mode. Use it for setup, variable
computation, and conditional abort.

```yaml
pre: |
  <bash script body>
```

The pre script is wrapped in a shell function (`_nerf_pre`). Key points:

- **Use `return` to abort, not `exit`.** `return 1` lets the wrapper report the failure. `exit`
  kills the entire script immediately, bypassing error reporting.
- **Print your own error messages.** The fallback message is generic. Write `echo "error: ..." >&2`
  before `return 1`.
- **Shell variables set in pre are visible to main.** Functions execute in the caller's scope.
- **`{{kind.name}}` placeholders work.** Parameters are parsed before pre runs.

Example:

```yaml
git-push-branch:
  description: Push the current branch to a remote
  threat:
    read: workspace
    write: remote
  template:
    command: [git, push, --follow-tags, "{{arguments.remote}}", HEAD]
  arguments:
    remote:
      description: Remote name
      required: true
      pattern: "^[a-z0-9_-]+$"
  pre: |
    BRANCH=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -z "$BRANCH" ]; then
      echo "error: cannot push from detached HEAD state" >&2
      return 1
    fi
    if [ "$BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
      echo "error: use git-push-main for the main branch" >&2
      return 1
    fi
```

## Environment

```yaml
env:
  VAR_NAME: "value"
```

Key-value pairs exported as environment variables before guards, pre, and main execution. Values are
static strings (no `{{kind.name}}` substitution). Keys must match `[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*`.

## Placeholder substitution

Placeholders use the form `{{kind.name}}` where `kind` is one of `switches`, `options`, or
`arguments`. They appear in `template.command`, `guard.command`, `guard.script`, and `pre` and are
replaced with shell variable references.

| Context          | Required scalar | Optional scalar             | Required variadic | Optional variadic       | Switch             | Repeatable option                |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| template command | `"$VAR"`        | `--flag $VAR` (conditional) | `"${VAR[@]}"`     | `${VAR[@]+"${VAR[@]}"}` | `${VAR:+"--flag"}` | `"${VAR[@]}"` (flag-value pairs) |
| guard/pre script | `${VAR}`        | `${VAR}`                    | `${VAR}`          | `${VAR}`                | `${VAR}`           | `${VAR}`                         |

In script contexts (guards, pre, inline script body), the author is responsible for quoting.

## Error messages

Generated scripts produce structured errors for both humans and AI agents:

```text
error: <tool-name>: <what went wrong>
  <detail lines>
  hint: <what to do instead>
```

The first line always starts with `error: <tool-name>:` so the caller can identify which tool
failed. Examples:

```text
error: nerf-git-commit: missing required argument <message>
  hint: provide a value for <message>

error: nerf-git-commit: argument <message> does not match required pattern
  value:   "updated readme"
  pattern: ^(feat|fix|docs|...)...
  hint: value must match ^(feat|fix|docs|...)...

error: nerf-safe-find: token '-exec' is not allowed (matched deny pattern '-exec')
  denied patterns: -exec, -execdir, -ok*, --delete
  hint: remove '-exec' and retry
```

## Dry-run mode

Every generated tool supports `--nerf-dry-run`. When passed as the first argument, the tool runs all
validation, guards, pre-hooks, and deny scans as normal, but instead of executing the final command
it prints what would be run and exits.

```bash
$ nerf-git-fetch --nerf-dry-run origin
dry-run: git fetch origin --tags

$ nerf-find-cwd --nerf-dry-run -name '*.py'
dry-run: find '.' -name *.py

$ nerf-deploy-check --nerf-dry-run staging
dry-run: nerf-deploy-check would run inline script
```

If a guard or deny rule would reject the invocation, the error is reported as usual:

```bash
$ nerf-find-cwd --nerf-dry-run -exec echo {} \;
error: nerf-find-cwd: token '-exec' is not allowed (matched deny pattern '-exec')
```

`--nerf-dry-run` must be the first token because the parser stops consuming flags at the first
unrecognized argument.

## Generated documentation

### Maps-to line

Every template and passthrough tool shows a **Maps to** line revealing the underlying command:

- **Template:** `Maps to: git commit -m <message>`
- **Passthrough:** `Maps to: find . "$@"`
- **Script:** no Maps-to line.

### Help text (--help)

Generated scripts include a `usage()` function with separate Switches, Options, and Arguments
sections, constraints shown inline, and the Maps-to line.

### AI skill files (SKILL.md)

Generated skill files follow the same structure formatted as markdown for AI assistants.
